# Hometown
A lightweight, modular data project that explores key demographic trends in my local community using U.S. Census data. This project is designed to evolve over time, starting with total population, median age, and educational attainment, and expanding to other socioeconomic indicators as needed.

# Purpose
To develop and showcase reproducible workflows for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing time-based demographic data at the local level.  And satisfy my curiosity!

# Features
- Pulls multi-year American Community Survey (ACS) data via the `tidycensus` R package  
- Calculates and visualizes key metrics:  
  - Total population  
  - Median age  
  - % of adults (25+) with a bachelor's degree or higher  
- Modular design for easy expansion with additional variables
